              <h2 ><b>Overview</b></h2>
              <p>Conversational systems have improved dramatically recently, and are receiving increasing attention in academic literature. However, significant research challenges remain spanning areas of dialogue systems, spoken natural language processing, human-computer interaction, and search and recommender systems, which all are exacerbated with demanding requirements of E-Commerce.
			<br>
			The <b>WSDM ConvERSe</b> workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in the areas of conversational systems, human-computer interaction, information retrieval, and recommender systems. Bringing diverse research areas together into a single workshop would accelerate progress on adapting conversation systems to the E-Commerce domain, to set a research agenda, to examine how to build and share data sets, and to establish common evaluation metrics and benchmarks to drive research progress.  <br>

                  <h5><b><i>Towards Mixed-Initiative Conversational Search</i></b></h5>

                  
                  <b>Abstract:</b> While conversational search has roots in early information retrieval research, recent advances in automatic speech recognition and conversational agents as well as popularity of devices with limited bandwidth interfaces have led to increasing interest in this area. An ideal conversational search system requires to go beyond the typical “query-response” paradigm by supporting mixed-initiative interactions. In this talk, I will review the recent efforts on developing mixed-initiative conversational search systems and draw connections with early work on interactive information retrieval. I will describe methods for generating and evaluating clarifying questions in response to search queries. I will further highlight the connections between conversational search and recommendation, and finish with a discussion on the next steps that require significant progress in the context of mixed-initiative conversational search.

                  <p>
                   <font color=#3377ff><b>Hamed Zamani</b></font></a> is a Researcher at Microsoft, working on a wide range of problems on neural information retrieval and conversational search. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst under direction of W. Bruce Croft. Hamed is an active member of the information retrieval (IR) community and is broadly interested in developing statistical and machine learning models with applications to information access systems, including search engines, question answering, and recommender systems. Much of his past research has focused on developing neural models for core IR tasks and proposing solutions for training these models in the absence of large-scale training data.

                  <b>Abstract:</b> Alexa Shopping at Amazon focuses on enabling users to shop with a multimodal device, driven by a voice interaction. Developing a customer-friendly shopping AI entails solving basic research problems such as natural language understanding, developing natural multi-turn dialogs, high-accuracy retrieval of sparse texts, and personalizing not just the result, but the interaction itself. In this talk we discuss commerce-specific open research problems facing Alexa in the coming years.

                  <b>Abstract:</b> Recent advances in deep learning and natural language processing are fueling a new generation of conversational agents that are accurate and articulate in interacting with users on a broad range of subjects. A number of conversational systems are also making their way to specific verticals such as banking, financing, healthcare, and e-commerce, and targeting consumers while supplanting real agents at scale in email, live chats or other types of communications.
                  <br><br>Although conversational agents are rapidly growing, some verticals such as e-commerce are still far from a frictionless user experience where conversion rates are seamlessly completed with voice-only “zero-click” purchases. In this talk, we illustrate a typical architecture and machine learning pipeline that have been both successfully used to optimize e-commerce conversational systems and discuss challenges that currently limit scalability and adoption.
